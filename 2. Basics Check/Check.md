# Basics Check

Do the following in the `Check.java` file.

Create arrays that meet the following criteria and assign them each to variables:
- An array that stores your class grades for Quarter 2.
- An array that stores the names of your classes from Quarter 2. Match these up with the grades array above (i.e., if the first grade in the grades array was for Computer Science, then make the first course name in this array `"AP Computer Science A"`).
- An array that stores you and your best friend using `Person` objects.

In the grades array, update your Computer Science grade by adding 5 points to it. Do this using array access/modification, not by changing your assignment statement. Print your grade in Computer Science before and after to show that the modification worked.

Pretend you and your best friends' birthdays just happened. Update both of your ages in the people array. Print your ages before and after to show that the modifications worked.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
