# Initial Try

In `Try.java`, there are 5 incomplete array assignment statements. Each line has something making the assignment incomplete (could be not enough written, could be too much).

Fix each assignment so that each array is initialized completely. If you need a length for the array, use a length of `5`.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
