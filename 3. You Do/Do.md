# You Do

Use the `Course.java` file to create a `Course` class. This class is meant to represent the classes you are taking in school. It should have the following components:
- Instance variables for name, subject, level (college, honors, high honors, AP, etc.), and block (1A, 2A, etc.).
- Default constructor and constructor for all instance variables given.
- Accessor and mutator methods for all instance variables.
- toString method so that we can print the objects nicely.

Once the `Course` class has been written, utilize it to make an array of `Course` objects in the `Do.Java` file to represent your schedule for Semester 2. Then, using your array, print out each element of the array to see your schedule written out using the `toString` method for the `Course` class. For example, here is the expected output for Mr. G's Semester 2 schedule:

```
1A - CS College Data Science 1
2A - CS College Computer Science 1
3A - CS AP Computer Science A
1B - Math College Algebra 2
3B - CS College Computer Science 1
4B - CS AP Computer Science A
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
