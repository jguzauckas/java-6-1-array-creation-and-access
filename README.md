# AP Computer Science A - Unit 4 Section 4

# Nested Iteration

This section introduces the idea of combining loops, or putting loops inside of one another to introduce new functionality and behavior.

Due to the nature of Java, certain elements of a Java program are going to be taken for granted and ultimately ignored as we work with the basics, but are required for the program to run successfully. I encourage you to read them and start to internalize them as they'll become a key aspect of the work we do as the year goes on.

This section covers the following material:

- Nested Iteration
- Inner Loops that Depend on Outer Loops

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
